# Modified Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation

This is a modified source code of Modified IQAE by Fukuzawa et al., obtained from (https://github.com/shifubear/Modified-IQAE). I restructured the code to work with the newest version of Qiskit, and cut down the code to streamline with our `qfinance` application. Since there is no `pip` installation options for MIQAE, I have included the streamlined code within our `qfinance` for easy application. I stress that the development of the logic for MIQAE is from Fukuzawa et al..
